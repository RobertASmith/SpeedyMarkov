<a href="#background" class="anchor"></a>Background</h2>
<p>The reference implementation of a Markov model makes use of an array structure and a series of nested loops to sample, simulate and summarise the model. This approach has some clear advantages including making optmisations possible across samples. However, its lack of modularity may make making optimisations more difficult and many also make generalising findings more difficult - as model definitions are linked to model sampling, solving and summarising.</p>
<p>In principle this approach may lead to the most efficient code but this may come at the cost of clarity and generalisability.</p>

<a href="#profiling" class="anchor"></a>Profiling</h2>
<p>As expected profiling indicates that the interior iteratively updated for loop operation accounts for the vast majority of the function run time (this makes senses as R is notoriously slow when it comes to this use case). The remaining run-time is taken up by within loop allocation of samples and data summarisation but in comparison to the iterative for loop compute costs are small. Profiling is implemented using the <code>profvis</code> package (<strong>Note: Profiling output will be more detailed in an interactive session post package install</strong>).</p>
<p>These results suggest several strategies. Firstly, to speed up the within for loop operation (here a matrix multiplication). This would also benefit other resource intensive matrix multiplications. Secondly, to decrease the costs of the iterative for loop itself - perhaps by moving to a <code>Rcpp</code> implementation. Finally, to make use of parallel compute to spread the costs of solving each sample across multiple CPUs.</p>

smoking cessation - used as a baseline and reference. Unlike\n#' other markov functions the reference functions contain all model setup, sampling, simulation and analysis code.\n#'  It has been developed primarily using base R and makes use of a nested array structure. This array is then looped\n#'  over using a series of nested for loops with a core loop running a the markov model for each sample and intervention. \n#'  Profiling suggestions that this core loop may take the majority of compute time.\n#'\n#' @param cycles Numeric, the number of cycles (time horizon / cycle length). No default supplied.\n#' @param samples Numeric, the number of samples to use. No default supplied.\n#' @return A named list of cost effectiveness output.\n#' @export\n#' @importFrom VGAM rdiric\n#' @importFrom stats rnorm\n#' @author Howard Thom\n#' @examples \n#' ## Example model run\n#' reference_two_state_markov(cycles = 10, samples = 100)\n#'\nreference_two_state_markov <- function(cycles = NULL, samples = NULL) {\n  set.seed(14143)\n   \n  # Define the number and names of treatments\n  # These are Standard of Care with website\n  # and Standard of Care without website\n  n.treatments<-2\n  treatment.names<-c(\"SoC with website\",\"SoC\")\n  \n  # Define the number and names of states of the model\n  # This is two and they are \"Smoking\" and \"Not smoking\"\n  n.states<-2\n  state.names<-c(\"Smoking\",\"Not smoking\")\n  \n  # Define the number of cycles\n  # This is 10 as the time horizon is 5 years and cycle length is 6 months\n  # The code will work for any even n.cycles (need to change the discounting code if\n  # an odd number of cycles is desired)\n  \n  n.cycles<-cycles\n  \n  # Define simulation parameters\n  # This is the number of PSA samples to use\n  n.samples<-samples\n  \n  #############################################################################\n  ##
