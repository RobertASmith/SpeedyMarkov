\title{Reference Two State Markov Model}
\usage{
reference_two_state_markov(cycles = NULL, samples = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cycles}{Numeric, the number of cylces (time horizon / cycle length). No default supplied.}

\item{samples}{Numeric, the number of samples to use. No default supplied.}
}
\value{
A named list of cost effectiveness output.

\description{
This is a two state Markov model - modelling smoking cessation - used as a baseline and reference. Unlike
other markov functions the reference functions contain all model setup, sampling, simulation and analysis code.
It has been developed primarily using base R and makes use of a nested array structure. This array is then looped
over using a series of nested for loops with a core loop running a the markov model for each sample and intervention.
Profiling suggestions that this core loop may take the majority of compute time.
